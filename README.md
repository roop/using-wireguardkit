# Using WireGuardKit

This is a sample project that demonstrates the setting up of a WireGuard tunnel
in an iOS app using [WireGuardKit](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-apple/about/#wireguardkit-integration).

This is known to work with Xcode 13. This will not work on the iOS Simulator.

To try out the app directly, see [USING.md](USING.md).

To create a new app from scratch like the app in this project, see [CREATING.md](CREATING.md).
